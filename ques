## üõ†Ô∏è **Tool-Specific Questions**

### 4. **What is Jenkins and why did you use it?**
**Answer**: Jenkins is an automation server used to build, test, and deploy code. It orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline.

### 5. **How does Maven help in your project?**
**Answer**: Maven is used to build the Java application, manage dependencies, and package the app into a WAR or JAR file.

### 6. **Why did you use Docker?**
**Answer**: Docker containerizes the application, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

### 7. **What is AWS ECR and its role in your project?**
**Answer**: AWS ECR is a container registry that stores Docker images. It allows Kubernetes to pull images securely for deployment.

### 8. **What is Kubernetes and why is it important?**
**Answer**: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### 9. **What is the role of Git and GitHub in your project?**
**Answer**: Git is used for version control, and GitHub hosts the code repository. Jenkins pulls code from GitHub to start the pipeline.

### 10. **What is an SSH key and how is it used in your project?**
**Answer**: An SSH key is a secure authentication method. It‚Äôs used to connect Jenkins to GitHub or EC2 instances without passwords.

Here are **more detailed questions and answers** that could be asked during a presentation or interview about your CI/CD pipeline project and the tools involved:

---

## üîç **Advanced Project Questions**

### 11. **How does Jenkins know when to start a build?**
**Answer**: Jenkins can be triggered by webhooks from GitHub, polling the repository at intervals, or manual triggers. Webhooks are preferred for real-time automation.

### 12. **What is the difference between CI and CD?**
**Answer**:  
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically builds and tests code when changes are pushed.  
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**: Automatically delivers or deploys the built code to production or staging environments.

### 13. **How did you secure your pipeline?**
**Answer**:  
- Used SSH keys for secure GitHub access.  
- Stored credentials in Jenkins using the Credentials plugin.  
- Limited access to Jenkins and Docker with proper user roles.

### 14. **What is the role of a Dockerfile in your project?**
**Answer**: A Dockerfile defines the steps to build a Docker image, including the base image, dependencies, and how to run the application.

### 15. **What is the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?**
**Answer**:  
- **Docker**: Packages and runs applications in containers.  
- **Kubernetes**: Manages and orchestrates multiple containers across a cluster.

## üß∞ **Tool-Specific Deep Dive**

### 16. **What is a Jenkins pipeline and how is it different from a freestyle job?**
**Answer**:  
- A **freestyle job** is a simple, GUI-based job configuration.  
- A **pipeline** is a script-based job (written in Groovy) that provides more control, flexibility, and supports complex workflows.

### 17. **What is ECR and how do you push an image to it?**
**Answer**:  
ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is AWS's Docker image repository.  
Steps to push:
1. Authenticate Docker to ECR using AWS CLI.  
2. Tag the image with the ECR repo URL.  
3. Push using `docker push`.

### 18. **What are Kubernetes manifests and what do they contain?**
**Answer**:  
Manifests are YAML files that define Kubernetes resources like Deployments, Services, and Pods. They specify configurations such as image, replicas, ports, and labels.

### 19. **How do you expose your application in Kubernetes?**
**Answer**:  
Using a **Service** object with type `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`, which exposes the app to external traffic.

### 20. **How do you monitor your CI/CD pipeline?**
**Answer**:  
- Jenkins provides build logs and status indicators.  
- Kubernetes can be monitored using `kubectl`, dashboards, or tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Here are **30 more questions and answers** related to your CI/CD pipeline project and the tools used. These cover practical, conceptual, and technical aspects that could be asked in interviews, reviews, or presentations:

---

## üîß **CI/CD & Jenkins**

1. **What is a Jenkins agent?**  
   *An agent is a machine or environment where Jenkins runs jobs. It can be local or remote.*
