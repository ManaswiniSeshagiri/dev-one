Here's a complete breakdown and explanation of the CI/CD workflow shown in the image using GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Tomcat, Amazon ECR, Kubernetes (EKS) — with the purpose of each tool and how they interact:


---

🔄 CI/CD Workflow Explanation

🧑‍💻 1. Developer Machine

Role: Where code is written and maintained.

Activity:

Code is developed using an IDE.

Developer uses Git commands to add, commit, and push code to GitHub.

Uses SSH key authentication for secure GitHub communication.




---

🌍 2. GitHub (GitHub Server)

Tool Type: Remote Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

Purpose: Stores code repositories remotely; triggers builds.

Workflow Role:

When the developer pushes code, a webhook triggers Jenkins automatically.

Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub repository for building.




---

🔧 3. Jenkins (CI Server)

Tool Type: Continuous Integration tool

Purpose: Automates the build, test, and deployment process.

Workflow Role:

Pulls code from GitHub on webhook trigger.

Uses Maven to compile and build the Java project.

Builds WAR/JAR files and either:

Deploys directly to Tomcat.

Builds Docker images and pushes them to Amazon ECR.

Applies Kubernetes manifests to deploy containers in EKS.





---

☕ 4. Maven

Tool Type: Java Build Automation Tool

Purpose: Compiles, tests, and packages Java code into .war or .jar.

Workflow Role:

Jenkins uses Maven to:

Download dependencies

Compile code

Package it into a deployable WAR file


WAR file can be deployed to Tomcat or used in a Docker image




---

🐱 5. Tomcat Server

Tool Type: Java Web Application Server

Purpose: Hosts Java .war files as web apps.

Workflow Role:

Jenkins integrates with Tomcat using credentials and Tomcat URL.

Automatically deploys the WAR file on Tomcat after successful build.

Used in early deployment (non-containerized environment).




---

🐳 6. Docker

Tool Type: Containerization Platform

Purpose: Packages applications into containers.

Workflow Role:

Jenkins uses Dockerfile to build Docker images from WAR file.

Images include app + environment (Tomcat base image + app).

Docker host/container runs the packaged application.

Jenkins uses SSH to connect with Docker server and execute Docker commands.




---

📦 7. Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

Tool Type: Container Registry by AWS

Purpose: Stores Docker images securely in the cloud.

Workflow Role:

Jenkins is configured to authenticate with ECR using AWS credentials.

Docker pushes the newly built image to ECR.

This ensures the latest image is always available for Kubernetes deployment.




---

☸️ 8. Kubernetes Server

Tool Type: Container Orchestration

Purpose: Deploys, scales, and manages containerized applications.

Workflow Role:

Jenkins executes kubectl commands to apply:

Deployment.yaml (defines pod specs)

Service.yaml (exposes pods to external network)


After each build, Jenkins updates Kubernetes deployments using ECR image.




---

☁️ 9. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Tool Type: Managed Kubernetes Cluster by AWS

Purpose: Provides scalable, secure, and managed Kubernetes environment.

Workflow Role:

Jenkins connects to EKS using kubectl + kubeconfig.

Deployments on Kubernetes run in EKS.

Pulls latest Docker image from Amazon ECR and runs as pods.

Accessed via Service IP exposed from Kubernetes.




---

🧭 Process Flow (Step-by-Step Summary)

Step	Activity	Tools Involved

1	Developer writes code and pushes to GitHub	Developer Machine → GitHub
2	GitHub triggers Jenkins via webhook	GitHub → Jenkins
3	Jenkins pulls code and builds using Maven	Jenkins + Maven
4	WAR file is deployed to Tomcat (optional stage)	Jenkins → Tomcat
5	Docker image is built from WAR and pushed to ECR	Jenkins → Docker → Amazon ECR
6	Jenkins applies deployment.yaml and service.yaml to Kubernetes	Jenkins → Kubernetes
7	Kubernetes pulls Docker image from ECR and runs it as pods	Kubernetes → Amazon ECR
8	Kubernetes exposes app via service (NodePort/LoadBalancer)	Kubernetes
9	App is accessed using the K8s Service IP in browser	User



---

📁 Kubernetes Files

Deployment.yaml: Defines app containers, replicas, image version, etc.

Service.yaml: Defines how the app is exposed (e.g., LoadBalancer IP)



---

✅ Final Output:

After everything is set up:

Developer pushes code → Pipeline runs automatically

App is built, containerized, and deployed to EKS

Access app using Kubernetes Service IP in browser
